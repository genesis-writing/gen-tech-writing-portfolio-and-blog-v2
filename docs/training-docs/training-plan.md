# Training Plan

## **Overview**

This document features an employee training plan template. Trainers can use this for new hires or existing team members. The plan follows a three-part structure: header, employee information, and module table.

For the post-training stage, refer to the <u>[Employee Training Evaluation Profile](employee-training-evaluation-profile.md)</u> page.

## **Employee Information**

  5. **Direct report**: Person responsible for managing the employee’s workload and performance (e.g., director, manager, supervisor).

## **Module Table**

This table outlines what the employee can expect during training sessions. You can scale this portion if more than one day of training is required.

Table Elements:

  * **Lesson topic**: Individual aspects of the module (e.g., high-level overview, data entry).
  * **Sub-topics**: Building blocks for each lesson (e.g., how to log in, how supporting teams use the system).
  * **Status**: Checkbox to indicate if the employee has completed the lesson.
