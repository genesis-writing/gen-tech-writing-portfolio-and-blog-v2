# Training Docs

## **Introduction**

I have delivered live and remote training to hundreds of individuals across various roles (e.g., networking, customer service, sales, project management). While delivery is critical for any training program, documentation is equally important.

## **Project Overview**

Assembling a full-fledged training plan is challenging. Documentation helps provide information to employees and collect data. A plan is dynamic, evolving with the business’s needs. A training plan provides the structure needed to maintain standardization across the organization. The follow-up stage evaluates the employee’s training experience. Without a solid training program, an organization may experience detrimental impacts on operations.

## **Content Structure**

### [Training Plan](training-plan.md)

This document features a scalable employee training plan template. It supports the application of any subject matter. Its simplicity benefits trainers and
employees alike. The first section collects employee information, while the second uses a modular approach for transparency.

### [Employee Training Evaluation Profile](employee-training-evaluation-profile.md)

This document features an employee training evaluation profile. Feedback is not only from the trainer to the employee but also identifies trends from training observations. For example, a common weakness in understanding an application among several employees might indicate the need to rework the training delivery style or method. This evaluation ensures the training plan evolves positively with the business’s needs.
