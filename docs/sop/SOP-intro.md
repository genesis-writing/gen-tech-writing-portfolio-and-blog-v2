# SOP

## **Introduction**

I have collaborated with various departments (e.g., project management, software development, customer service, technical support) to create a wide array of SOPs. I have also developed processes from scratch and documented them.

## **Project Overview**

SOPs are integral to the day-to-day operations of any business. This documentation needs to provide enough information for readers to understand while balancing the necessary knowledge to complete tasks accurately. Having frameworks in place ensures a satisfied organization and reduces errors that could lead to time loss.

## **Content Structure**

### [Business Operation Process](business-operation-process.md)

This document illustrates an example of a project delivery process involving five departments working together to provide a set of deliverables. It includes an audit process that serves as a verification point to ensure a high-quality end product. If the audit fails twice, department leaders must meet to identify what went wrong and prevent recurrence. I created two diagrams to illustrate how the process flows between each department: one is a sequence diagram created with Mermaid, and the other is a swimlane diagram created with draw.io.
