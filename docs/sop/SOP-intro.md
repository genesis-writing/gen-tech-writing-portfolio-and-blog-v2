# SOP

## **Introduction**

I have collaborated with various departments (e.g., project management, software development, customer service, technical support) to create a wide array of SOPs. I have also developed processes from scratch and documented them.

## **Project Overview**

SOPs are integral to the day-to-day operations of any business. This documentation needs to provide enough information for readers to understand while balancing the necessary knowledge to complete tasks accurately. Having frameworks in place ensures a satisfied organization and reduces errors that could lead to time loss.

## **Content Structure**

### [Business Operation Process](business-operation-process.md)

This document shows an example of a project delivery process. It involves five departments working together to provide a set of deliverables. It includes an audit process that acts as a verification point to ensure a high-quality end product. If the audit fails twice, department leaders must meet to identify what went wrong and prevent recurrence. The swimlane diagram represents how the process flows between each department.
