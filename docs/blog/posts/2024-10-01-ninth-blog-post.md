# My First Mermaid Diagram :simple-mermaid:

It’s hard to believe it’s been almost three months since my [July 5th post](2024-07-05-third-blog-post.md) where I first talked about the magic of Mermaid. I’ve finally taken a stab at creating my own diagram. I based it on the swimlane diagram I originally developed for my [Business Operation Process](../../sop/business-operation-process.md) sample. However, I learned that Mermaid doesn’t support swimlane diagrams. In fact, you can refer to open GitHub [issue #2028](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/2028) to see the ever-growing list and demand to add swimlane functionality.

Since swimlanes are crucial for showing the transfer of information between five departments in my case, I opted for a sequence diagram. I figured this would at least show the interaction between different parties.
