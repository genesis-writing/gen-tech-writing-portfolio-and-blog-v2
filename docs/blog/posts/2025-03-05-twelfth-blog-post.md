# My Intro to Vale CLI

As I dove deeper into docs as code, I discovered something pretty cool: there are tools that can automate tasks like spell checking and style guide adherence, and you can run them right from your command line!

One tool that kept popping up was [Vale CLI](https://vale.sh/). It's a free, open-source command-line tool that's way more than just a spellchecker. Vale ensures your writing consistently adheres to a style guide. This is incredibly helpful, especially when human eyes start to miss things because, let's be real, after staring at the same doc for hours, it all blurs together, right? ðŸ˜… It's effectively a linter, but specifically for writing. How neat is that?

What's particularly valuable is the ability to create custom rules or leverage established and respected style guides from organizations like Google or Microsoft. While I'm planning to implement Vale for my portfolio to maintain consistency, I immediately recognized its potential for enhancing team collaboration and ensuring consistent style across all documentation.

Tonight, I just skimmed Vale CLI's documentation on their [website](https://vale.sh/docs) and completed the installation. This is just the tip of the iceberg, and Iâ€™m excited to start using it for my portfolio and further explore Vale CLIâ€™s capabilities.
