# Initial Thoughts on MkDocs

Today, as I drank my morning coffee and contemplated how to spend my lazy Sunday, I had an interesting thought. I already built a static site with Docusaurus (check it out [**here**](https://genwrites.netlify.app/), by the way), so why not do the same with MkDocs? I frequently see technical writers praise MkDocs, just like Docusaurus, for its powerful documentation tools. I wanted to check it out myself, and when I coupled it with the Material framework...whoa!

So yeah, that's what I ended up doing today. There are certainly things I like and dislike about both. I guess the same could be said about food (personally, I'm not a fan of my greens). I'll sum up those thoughts in another blog, another day.
