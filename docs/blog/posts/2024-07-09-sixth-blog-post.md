# Migrating from Wordpress

It's been almost one week since I decided to move away from WordPress and onto a static site generator. I started my journey with <u>[Docusaurus](https://genwrites.netlify.app/)</u> and then stumbled upon MkDocs. I'm still unsure which generator I'll actually stick with, as I still have much to learn before making that decision. I do like that MkDocs supports <u>[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/)</u>.

All I know is that both Docusaurus and MkDocs are much better than WordPress :face_with_hand_over_mouth: (for my portfolio, I meanâ€”no disrespect to WordPress :grimacing:).
