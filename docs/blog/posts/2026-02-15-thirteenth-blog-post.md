# 2025 Year in Review

I just realized I haven't written a blog post in almost a year. I’ve been heads-down setting new goals in both my personal and professional life, focusing on growth not just as a Technical Writer, but as a human being. It felt like the right time to pause and reflect on the whirlwind that was 2025.

Spoiler alert: It was even better than 2024.

Last year was defined by two major themes, fitness and AI. Oddly enough, they intertwined in ways I didn't expect.

## My Fitness Journey

One of my primary resolutions for 2025 was to get strong. At the start of the year, I couldn't perform a single proper push-up. I spent the majority of the year learning about nutrition and strength training, which was eye-opening because I had so many misconceptions.

A few big things I learned:

- Weight loss is fundamentally about balance. No amount of exercise was going to outdo a bad diet, so I had to clean that up.
- Cardio is not enough. I learned that muscle burns more calories than fat at rest, so if I wanted to stay fit long-term, I had to start strength training.
- Small steps add up. If I couldn't do a regular push-up, starting on my knees was a necessary step and not a failure.

I started tracking my intake and lifting 3 to 4 times a week. Over time I felt better, looked better, and had a lot more energy. As for those push-ups? I can now do 21 in a row. Not from my knees, just regular ones! I’ve even ventured into other forms like diamond push-ups.

### Using AI as a Fitness and Nutrition Coach

It was sometimes overwhelming to pay attention to both my nutrition and exercises, so I leveraged ChatGPT and Gemini to help keep me on track.

- Nutrition: I use the chatbots to guess approximate calories and macros for home-cooked meals based on ingredients and weights. This has been invaluable for keeping my nutrition on track. I’ve seen so many ads for apps that claim they can tell you the nutrition info just by taking a picture of your plate, but I find that a bit silly. How can an app know the exact macros without weighing the food? It’s the same issue we face in Tech Writing: without the right context, the output is just a guess. A photo doesn't provide the "data context" that a scale and a list of ingredients do.
- Coach: One of the funnest uses has been using a chatbot as a coach to evaluate workout performance. This was as easy as feeding it a CSV export from my workout tracker app. If my numbers indicated a plateau, we'd create a gameplan to overcome that safely. It even reminded me to rest when I got minor injuries, which is a good reminder since we usually want to power through things.

## Leveling Up to Senior Technical Writer

In early 2025, I was promoted to Senior Technical Writer. This was a milestone I’m incredibly proud of. I seriously love being a Technical Writer because you get to learn something new all the time and teach others through your words.

This promotion felt like a natural progression of my growth over the last year. Even as the sole technical writer, I've reached a point where I'm leading our documentation strategy with much more maturity. I’m operating at a much higher level of efficiency and delivering high-quality work faster and more effectively than ever before.

## AI as a Collaborator

In my [2024 review](2025-02-22-eleventh-blog-post.md) I discussed how I used custom GPTs for proofreading. In 2025, the game changed entirely.

### Solving the Context Gap with MCP

The biggest technical shift for me was the introduction of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol). Previously, providing an AI model with enough context was a convoluted process involving HTML exports and Python scripts to convert docs to Markdown.

MCP bridged the gap between our documentation set and the LLM. For the first time, I had a context-aware collaborator. This allowed me to gather information across our entire knowledge base instantly, which greatly accelerated how fast I could create initial drafts for complex features.

### Speech to Text and Patterns

I’ve also changed how I interact with my machine:

- Speech-to-text: I don't type as much anymore. Speech-to-text is mainly how I build prompts and refine my documentation. It feels more like talking to a colleague when I do this. (Though my mechanical keyboards aren't going anywhere because they're just too cool!)
- Patterns: Once I unlocked the power of context, I started noticing recurring patterns in my projects. I realized I could scale this and become faster than ever. I’m spending more time engineering the prompts and the system, and less time on the repetitive content tasks.

## 2026 Here We Go

Looking back at 2024, it’s incredible to see how much generative AI and my documentation workflow have evolved. In 2025, AI moved from a tool I used to a partner I collaborated with. It's been fun and I actually enjoy this dynamic.

I've already experimented a bit with agents, mainly to create reports and things that fall outside of producing documentation, but there is a lot more to learn there. In 2026 my goal is to dive even deeper and integrate these agents into a full writing system. What's next is learning how to use AI to automate more of the mundane stuff so I can focus on the fun and cool stuff.

It's incredible to think of what I was doing with AI just a year ago. What a huge jump! What advances await us this year, who knows? I'm excited to find out 🚀.

And finally, a note to past Genesis: [Last February](2025-03-05-twelfth-blog-post.md), I aimed to write more and didn't quite hit the mark. That resolution is going back on the 2026 list. See you in the next post!
