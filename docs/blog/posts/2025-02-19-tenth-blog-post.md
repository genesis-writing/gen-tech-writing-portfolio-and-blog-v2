# First Post of 2025

I'm going to try to keep this one short and sweet. Mostly because there are many things I want to say and I don't want to turn this into a lengthy scroll ðŸ˜¬.

I've been meaning to get to writing this post for a while now, but life's unpredictability and the 2024 holiday season definitely delayed the process. I've also made a resolution to work on my fitness and have been doing my best to stick to a discipline of exercising six days a week. I'm proud to say that it's been 6.5 weeks since I started and I'm still going strong! Scheduling my workout right before work energizes me. I'm also finding that I sleep better at night. Some of the exercises I've been doing have breathing routines, and I think those are great for clearing my brain before tackling my day so I can do my best work.

Anyway, happy 2025! Happy to be here, learning and thriving. 2024 was an incredible year in my growth as a human being and a Technical Writer. I'll be whipping up a post to summarize 2024 but just wanted to express my gratitude in making it to the other side. 2025, here we go!

Oh and yeah, one of my other resolutions is to write more blog posts to capture my learning journey and beef up my writing portfolio ðŸ˜Ž.
