# Mermaid?

Today, I learned about a new technology called [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/). It turns words into diagrams? How? My mind is blown! As a Technical Writer, creating diagrams can be pretty time-consuming. At first, I thought it could only handle flowcharts, but it can also create Gantt charts and user journey maps!

I can't wait to see how I can use Mermaid to speed up that process ðŸ¤¯.
