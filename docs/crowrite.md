# Crowrite - Final Project for CS50x

Crowrite is a Flask application that assists Technical Writers with their day-to-day tasks. I created this application as my final project for <u>[Harvard CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)</u> course. The name "Crowrite" combines my love for birds and writing, and I think it sounds neat 😎.

In a nutshell, here's how I built it:

- Jinja for templates and various Bootstrap components
- sqlite3 database to contain usernames and hashed passwords
- API call to display a random bird picture on the home page for authenticated users
- API call to retrieve definitions for user-submitted words
- Beautiful Soup to parse a user-submitted webpage's HTML structure and extract all headings to create a summary
- Beautiful Soup to parse an Atom feed's XML structure to extract monthly newsletter titles, published timestamps, and content links
