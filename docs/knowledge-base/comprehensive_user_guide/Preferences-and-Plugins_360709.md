# Preferences and Plugins

## **Purpose**

This guide highlights the available options within the app's preferences and shows you how to enable plugins to enhance your user experience. The keyboard shortcut for preferences or plugins is ⌘ , (command + key).

## **Preferences**

### General

This general section contains various settings for customizing your recording experience. Some settings allow you to choose options from dropdown menus, such as selecting the destination folder for recordings, while others use toggle buttons for features like showing or hiding the cursor.

  1. **Show cursor**: Hide or display the mouse cursor within your recordings.
  2. **Highlight clicks**: If "Show cursor" is enabled, highlight clicks made during a recording by surrounding the cursor with a circle.
