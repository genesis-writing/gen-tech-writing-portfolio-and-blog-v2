# Project Info

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the wiki portion of my portfolio. I am a big fan of creating wiki documentation because it allows users to access content in a highly structured environment. I have built wiki content from scratch and collaborated with subject matter experts to enhance existing knowledge bases.

## **Project Overview – Kap**

I decided to build a user guide for [Kap](https://getkap.co/), an open-source screen recording application I’ve used for years. Despite its simplicity, I had to navigate its interface without user-oriented documentation. Thus, this
project was born.

## **Content Structure**

### [Setting Up Kap](./setting_up_kap/Installation-Guide_327695.md)

This parent page contains two child pages to help users set up the Kap application on their system. The first child page includes installation guidelines, while the second provides a guide to grant screen recording access to the app.

### [Quick Start Guide](Quick-Start-Guide_327712.md)

This stand-alone page helps users dive right into using the application. It provides just enough information to get started without overwhelming beginners.

### [Comprehensive User Guide](./comprehensive_user_guide/Tool-Bar_393330.md)

This parent page contains a more detailed guide with four child pages. It begins by highlighting the available options within the toolbar, then focuses
on the app’s preferences and optional plugins. Next, it covers the built-in editor that helps users save their work. Lastly, it walks users through the process of completing a screen recording.

!!! note

    Kap is currently only available on macOS 12 or later.
