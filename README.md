# Genesis Sorto's Technical Writing Portfolio and Blog
Welcome to my portfolio and blog!

I used [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a modern static website generator, and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) framework to build this website.

[![Built with Material for MkDocs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Material_for_MkDocs-526CFE?style=for-the-badge&logo=MaterialForMkDocs&logoColor=white)](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

I deploy builds to Netlify.
